AI Mental Health & Student Wellness Companion:
Project Overview:-
1)The AI Mental Health & Student Wellness Companion is a web-based application designed to support students in managing academic stress, emotional challenges, and overall well-being.
2)Students often hesitate to seek help for stress, anxiety, or burnout. This system provides a safe and supportive digital space where students can express their thoughts, receive compassionate responses, and track their emotional patterns over time.
3)The application combines AI-powered conversational support with wellness tracking and mood analytics to promote healthier academic and personal balance.

The primary objective of this project is to:-
i)Provide emotional support for students through an AI-based chat interface
ii)Detect mood patterns using sentiment analysis
iii)Encourage balanced academic and lifestyle habits
iv)Offer motivational and wellness-oriented guidance
v)Promote awareness of mental well-being
